## Resources

You can find the `paper`, the `slides` presented at ECML PKDD, and the `poster` presented at ECML PKDD in this repository.

## Code

[TO BE UPDATED] In the `src/` folder, you will find a minimal implementation of:

1. The `ALBA` active learning algorithm (our main contribution).
2. The _baselines_ compared in the paper.
3. Instructions on how to use the algorithms and an illustration on toy data.

## Images

In the `images/` folder, you will find _pdf_ files for some of the main images showed in the paper.

## Data - disclaimer

The datasets used in the experiments of the paper are proprietary and can unfortunately not be shared at the moment.
