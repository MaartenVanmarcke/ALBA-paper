## Resources

You can find the `paper`, the `slides` presented at ECML PKDD, and the `poster` presented at ECML PKDD in this repository.

## Code

In the `src/` folder, you will find a minimal implementation of:

1. The `ALBA` active learning algorithm (our main contribution).
2. The _baselines_ compared in the paper.
3. Instructions on how to use the algorithms and an illustration on toy data.
